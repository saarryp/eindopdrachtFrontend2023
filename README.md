## About The Project

This project is a final assignment for front-end bootcamp at the Novi University of Applied Science.
The project was created by using the API last.fm (https://www.last.fm/).

This application is for all disco-funk-jazz-gospel-house-heads that like to be inspired by fellow music-lovers. What is
the deal?
Say you are stranded at a deserted island and you can only pick 10 favorite tunes. Or the DJ for that night with only 10
songs to be spinned. You have to chose wisely. What tracks would you pick? It is way harder than you think to limit
yourself. That in itself is a challenge, right?
The goal is to limit yourself and to inspire other people with artists or tracks that are rare or just simply a standard
banger. Just because algorithms often don't bring you songs that might inspire you, just what is often listened to. A
sort a crate digging to engage your curiosity.
