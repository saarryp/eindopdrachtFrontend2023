# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## About The Project

This project is a final assignment for front-end bootcamp at the Novi University of Applied Science. The project was created with the help of API last.fm (https://www.last.fm/) and three photos that are to be found on internet.

This application is for all disco-funk-jazz-gospel-house-heads that like to be inspired by fellow music-lovers. What is the deal?
say you are stranded at a deserted island and you have to pick 10 favorite tunes in that music-genre. Those are the only songs you can listen to. What tracks would you pick? It is way harder than you think to limit yourself. That in itself is a challenge, right?
The goal is to limit yourself and to inspire other people with artists or tracks that are rare or just simply a standard banger. Just because algorithms often don't bring you songs that might inspire you, just what is often listened to. A sort a crate digging to engage your curiosity.

### Installation

To run this web apllication make sure that you have an IDE such as Webstorm to compile the code.

New at this?

1. Download the application
    Via a zip file
    Via an SSH link
2. Install the dependencies
3. Start the application

Installing via a Zip
1. Go to GitHub and click on <> Code to download the zip file.
2. After downloading the zip file, you need to extract the file. Navigate to the file and right-click on it, then click on Extract All.
 Once you have extracted the file, you can go to your IDE of choice. In this example, we will be using the Jet Brains IDE, called WebStorm. When you open the IDE, go to Projects/Open.
3. Then navigate to the extracted file, click on the folder where everything is located, and click OK. Proceed to step 2.

Installing via a Git link
1. Go to GitHub and click on <> Code and copy the SSH link.
2. Go directly to your IDE of choice. In this example WebStorm is used (Jet Brains IDE) . Once opened the IDE, go to Projects/Get from VCS.
3. Paste the link you copied into the URL bar and click on Open.

Not new at this? then just follow these steps:

A. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saarryp/eindopdrachtFrontend2023
   
B. install project dependencies using npm

npm install

C. start development server

   npm start

D. open your webbrowser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the application

NOTE: YOU CAN MAKE AN ACCOUNT FOR 1 HOUR. IT IS RUNNING AT A BACKEND FROM SCHOOL, SO LIMITED TIME-WISE...
* CREATE AN ACCOUNT: click the registration button to create an account. 
* LOGIN: use the login button to log in.
* MY SOUNDS: you can manage your own list of 10 tunes that are not to be missed.
* SEARCH: you can find tracks and artistnames
* OUR SOUNDS: check what tunes we like and make us curious and proud what you come up with.


## Usage
Just enjoy the funky ride, no other things that need to be mentioned!

## SHOUT OUT TO
MANY, but these ones in particular Rowan (bless you for your patience!), Tessa, Nova, Rav, Elwyn and Sam for leading me the way in code-jungle.
